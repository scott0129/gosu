# Web Osu
An online web version of the popular desktop rhythm game, Osu!

## Motivation
One of my favorite games is a rhythm game called Osu! However, it's a desktop game and I've
always felt that it would make a lot of sense for there to be a web version. 

In a sense, there IS a web version, but it's unfortunately a [a bit lackluster](https://www.osu-web.com/)
## Technologies, Tools, Style guides
Since this will be a web game, the typical web stack (Parcel, TypeScript, Prettify)  
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for fast and fluid animation/movement  
Filesystem storage on the server for downloading/caching the songs  
## High-level functionalities
### Proof of concept
 - Implement a simple clicking game in 3 ways
### Menu
### Music Browser
### Playability
### Enjoyability
## Sketch?
Most of the design inspiration will come from the original OSU game. The menu for the game looks something like this:

And the gameplay looks like this:

## Schedule
### Week 1: Proof of concept
 - Implement the essential game (click some circles with timer accuracy) elements using 3 different methods:
    1. Using Html DOM elements
    2. Using Pixi.js, a 2d rendering engine
    3. Using Phaser, a 2d game engine
 - With some insight gained, choose one of the three options that seems to make the most sense.
### Week 2: Menu and Music Browser
